# Sunnyside Agency

-   Create a public repository: `sunnyside-agency`
-   Duration: 2 days
-   Deadline: 7/12/2023 - 09:00
-   Submission form: https://forms.gle/NjEmAtXAgnkXoBFA8

## Learning objectives

-   Write meaningful, semantically correct HTML (check on W3C)
-   Use modern positioning techniques using the `grid` and/or `flexbox` model
-  Use the BEM methodology
-   Create a "pixel-perfect" integration from a given wireframe
-   Use the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## The mission

![desktop preview](./desktop-preview.jpg)

You've been asked to implement a design for a newly created agency.

The graphic designer gave you all the elements so you can code the thing yourself. You have 2 days, but with the power of flexboxes and grids you should be able to make it!

-   The [desktop design](./resources/desktop-design.jpg) end product should match this image

-   The [mobile design](./resources/mobile-design.jpg) end product should match this image

-   You don't need to implement the burger menu on the mobile view yet, just focus on the rest of the elements. Do it as a bonus once the rest is done.

Good luck!
